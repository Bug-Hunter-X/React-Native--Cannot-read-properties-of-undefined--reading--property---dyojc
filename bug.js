This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  It's common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching, where the data might not be available immediately when the component renders.  For example, if you have a state variable `userData` that's fetched from an API, and you try to access `userData.name` before the data has been fetched and updated in the state, you'll get this error.
